            <p>Me and Job hunting</p>
            <p>So this is my first blog post.</p>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Hoang, as I am writing this blog post, my journey as a software developer started
                about a year ago, as a React Native Developer in April 2019. I have a passion for software development,
                the excitement of learning new technologies, the thrill of solving problems with your own code and the
                fulfillment of sharing your knowledge with others.
            </p>
            <p>"It is hard getting a job!"</p>
            <p>
                I am currently looking for an opportunity as a software developer in Finland. I have been searching for
                nearly half a year now, I have been to recruiting events, I have talked with recruiters on Linkedin, I
                have had companies sending me tasks, I have shaken a lot of hands and been on plenty of phone calls with
                HR and I have yet to find a place for me to start my journey in Finland's tech industry.
            </p>
            <p>Rejection hits you hard!</p>
            <p>
                From October to mid-December 2019, after a lot of no response or straight-up rejection from companies
                due to lacking in experience or relevant projects, I felt bad, undeserving and maybe I don't have what
                it takes to be in this competitive industry. I felt dumb even. I lost my way for a while...
            </p>
            <p>"Why is it so hard!"</p>
            <p>Defeated, I decided to look back at my strategy for job hunting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I advertise myself as being able to quickly learn and get the job done. </li>
                <li>I have a lot of passion for technology.</li>
                <li>I have a universal Cover Letter and CV. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>"It's a marathon, not a sprint"</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Able to learn and do the job sounds good on paper, but reading this with no proof to back it up
                    gives it no substance.{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                    I love technology but I barely have any work to show for it. At the time I got maybe 5 to 7
                    repository on GitHub.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Universal Cover Letter and CV, it might be fast and efficient for you, but the recruiters do not
                    appreciate the little amount of time you put into them.{" "}
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I am sure that someone already said this before me but I came to this realization about job hunting back
                in December 2019 and I have been living by it ever since. Now, what do I mean by that? I guess I'll have
                to leave it for next time, I aim for less than 500 words per entry as I hate lengthy post, and I am sure
                some would appreciate this too.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for reading.</p>
