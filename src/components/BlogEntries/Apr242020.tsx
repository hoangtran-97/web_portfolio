            <p className="blog-entry">The sprint</p>
            <p>
                When I first got out of my 6 months long internship at GMO in October, I was so sure about myself, I rushed headfirst into job searching. I felt like
                I could learn anything anyone threw at me, I felt like there is nothing too challenging for me because I have been there multiple times and always
                solving the problem one way or another.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I packed up my CV with projects I did, the things I learned, and ship them to every React Native / React entry position I could find. The first
                wave of CVs was to more than 30 companies. Whenever they asked for a cover letter or additional information, I always attached a general purpose
                cover letter that I have prewritten. This process was really fast, I wanted it to be fast, I want to promote myself to as many people as possible and
                get that HR phone call as soon as possible. I average 4-5 CV sent per day when I am high on that job hunting wave, so many companies, so many
                possibilities.

            <p className="blog-entry">Slowing down</p>
            <p>
                During the "sprint", I only got 2 HR calls with one Hackerrank task and programming task. I failed both. This is around November - December 2019.
                This setback really discouraged me, forcing me to rethink my strategy and to re-evaluate my knowledge.

                Sprinting is running a short distance over a short period of time. I sprinted for a month, I ran a short distance: 2 companies responded to me. And
                now at the end of the sprint, I feel tired and burned out. If I want to have a proper job, I need to slow down, to stop sprinting and move forward
                carefully.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-entry">Time for a marathon</p>
            <p>
                I guess the lesson learned here is, you simply can't rush it. I came up with a better plan for the long term, a marathon, a plan that I think and
                hope will work in the long run, I do not expect to see the result right away but I know that it will be better than sprinting.
            </p>
            <p>I will go into detail of my plan in the final part of this blog series (promise!)</p>
